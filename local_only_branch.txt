This branch is used to maintain a version that uses existing
git repos in the vagrant directory. It's used when the workshop
is distributed on USB drive so that people aren't required to
have SSH clients configured. 

"Branches are bad", but having some sort of switch in things like
workshop documentation which cause confusing is probably worse
